"""Command-line benchmark for the product catalog API (standard library only).

For each scenario, ONE request is issued as an unmeasured warmup, then
``--runs`` requests are timed. Every request is measured client-side as
wall-clock time (connect + full body read), in milliseconds. No request is
retried: each sample is one real round-trip.

Scenario 5 is a two-phase PUT scenario: rename one category to a temporary
name (phase "rename"), then rename it back to the original name (phase
"restore"), leaving a clean state afterwards. Each phase follows the usual
1-warmup + N-measured pattern, and EVERY measured PUT performs a real
rename: before each measured PUT the category's current id is re-resolved
by name from a fresh /api/categories fetch (so an implementation that
re-issues the id on rename keeps working), and an unmeasured companion PUT
restores the starting state before the next sample. The temporary name is
chosen ONCE before the runs: it is the original name plus " (bench)"; when
that exact name is already taken a counter grows — " (bench-2)",
" (bench-3)", ... — until the candidate is outside the current name set.
After scenario 5 the script re-fetches
the category list: if the sorted name list no longer matches the one
captured before scenario 5, an error is printed and the process exits with
code 2. When the category list is empty, scenario 5 prints "skip" and the
run exits with code 0.
